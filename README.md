# 🍽️ WAITER TIPPING PROBLEM 🍽️

Welcome to the "WAITER TIPPING PROBLEM" project! This project utilizes machine learning to predict the tipping behavior of customers based on various dining experience metrics. The core model employs a Decision Tree Regressor to estimate the tip amount given user inputs on various aspects such as food quality, service quality, ambiance, wait time, and the total bill amount.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to help estimate the tip amount a customer might leave at a restaurant. This could be beneficial for:
- Restaurant staff to better understand and predict tipping behaviors.
- Customers to gauge an appropriate tip based on their dining experience.

## 📋 Features

The model takes into account the following features:
- **Food Quality**: Rating of the food quality (1-5)
- **Service Quality**: Rating of the service quality (1-5)
- **Ambiance**: Rating of the restaurant's ambiance (1-5)
- **Wait Time**: Rating of the waiting time (1-5)
- **Price**: Total bill amount ($)

## 🛠️ Installation

To run this project, the following libraries are necessary:
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waiter-tipping-problem.git
   cd waiter-tipping-problem
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `Waiter Tipping Problem.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells to train the model and make predictions based on user inputs.

## 📊 Example Code

Here is an example code snippet used in this project:
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionLikeRegressor
import numpy as np

# Define features and the target (tip amount)
features = [...]
target = [...]

# Load and prepare data, train the model
...

# Predict tip based on user input
predicted_tip = model.predict(user_features)
print(f"Predicted Tip: ${predicted_tip:.2f}")
```
